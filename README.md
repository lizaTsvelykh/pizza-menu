# Fast React Pizza Co.

Fast React Pizza Co. is a simple web application built with React. It displays a menu of pizzas available for order. The menu is dynamically generated from a data file and includes the pizza name, ingredients, price, and a photo. The application also indicates whether a pizza is sold out.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `public/`: This directory contains static files such as the HTML file and images.
- `src/`: This directory contains the React JavaScript files.
- `package.json`: This file lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated and describes the exact tree of dependencies that were installed.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the application.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the application by running `npm start`.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
